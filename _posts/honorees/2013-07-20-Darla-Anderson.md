Darla K. Anderson joined Pixar Animation Studios in 1993.  Since then, her prodigious producing talents have contributed to some of the world’s most beloved and acclaimed animated feature films including “A Bug’s Life,” “Monsters, Inc.,” and the Golden Globe®-winners “Cars” and “Toy Story 3.” Anderson earned the award for Producer of the Year in Animated Theatrical Motion Pictures from the Producers Guild of America for her work on the Academy Award®-winning feature, “Toy Story 3,” an award she was also honored with for her work on “Cars.”  Her work on “Toy Story 3” was also recognized with a Best Picture nomination from both the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Producers Guild of America.    
 
Before assuming her feature film production duties, Anderson was the executive producer of Pixar Animation Studios’ commercial group.  Prior to joining Pixar, she worked with Angel Studios in Carlsbad, California as the executive producer of their commercial division.  It was here she was introduced to the world of 3D computer graphics, and from there she relocated to the Bay Area, with the intention of gaining a position at Pixar.
 
As one of the studio’s and the animation industry’s most accomplished producers, Anderson was elected to the Producers Council Board of the Producers Guild of America in July 2008.  She is the first producer from the animation arena to be elected to the Council.    
 
Born and raised in Glendale, California, Anderson studied environmental design at San Diego State University.  Soon thereafter she began her career in the entertainment industry, working on San Diego-based film and television productions.  Anderson currently resides in the San Francisco Bay Area.
