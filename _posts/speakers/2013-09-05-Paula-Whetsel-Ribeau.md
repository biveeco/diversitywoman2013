She is responsible for providing leadership to enhance the University’s efforts in building a truly inclusive, welcoming, academic community for all students, faculty, and staff.  She will play a critical role in creating a culture and campus life that supports and enriches the multi-ethnicity of the student body.  In addition, she will work with the President to further advance the Mount’s reputation in Annapolis, Washington DC, and local community through active participation with government offices, foundations, and professional associations.
