Bruce J. Stewart currently serves as the Deputy Director for Training, Compliance, and Strategic Initiatives in the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, Office of Personnel Management (OPM).   OPM provides human resources, leadership, and support to all Federal agencies and helps the Federal workforce achieve their missions as they serve the American people.  OPM is responsible for keeping the government running smoothly — a responsibility that has daily consequences for every citizen.   In 2011, President Obama issued Executive Order 13583, Establishing a Coordinated Government-Wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce.  Due to the variety of his outstanding and varied academic and practical experience in diversity programs, Mr. Stewart was hand-selected to implement the President’s Executive Order on Diversity and Inclusion.
 
Mr. Stewart retired as an Lt Colonel from the United States Air Force in October 2007, after 23 years of service. During his service he was attached to the Special Forces, served as a Management Engineer, and was a Computer and Communications Commander. His last assignment was as the Air National Guard’s (ANG) Director of Cultural Diversity Transformation.  After retiring, Mr. Stewart founded i-Global Network Inc., which serves as a Management Consultant firm that specializes in helping organizations create healthy cultures. i-Global Network does this through a focus on leadership, diversity, team-building, and cultural change education.
 
Mr. Stewart has also served and continues to be involved in numerous leadership and diversity initiatives at the local, state, and national levels. He has lectured on diversity at several leading educational institutions including MIT, Harvard, University of Kansas, and the Naval NCO Academy.  As a recognized subject matter expert on diversity, he was appointed as an advisor to President Obama’s Military Leadership Diversity Commission (MLDC).   Mr. Stewart is a sought after speaker on all components of diversity and inclusion, and regularly presents seminars, workshops, and keynote presentations for diversity conferences, government agencies, and webinars.
 
He has a Bachelor of Science degree from Southern Illinois University and a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from Friends University. He has also completed course requirements for a PhD in Organizational Development.
  
Mr. Stewart authored a book on leadership diversity titled, Cultural Leadership: The New Chemistry of Leading Differently, and has a second book scheduled to publish this fall titled, Diversitopia.
