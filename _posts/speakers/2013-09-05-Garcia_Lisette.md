Lisette Garcia joined the staff of the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility (HACR) in September 2012, revitalizing the role of Director, HACR Research Institute and charting a strategic plan and roadmap for the Institute. In addition to managing HACR’s CII and the Corporate Governance Study, Dr. Garcia takes the lead in facilitating the organization’s investigative projects and developing new programs and research studies aimed at strengthening HACR’s reputation as the key source for information on Hispanic inclusion in Corporate America.
A trained researcher with a Ph.D. in Sociology from The Ohio State University, Garcia has dedicated her career to exploring educational and employment issues within the realm of corporate social responsibility, discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. Garcia has published several articles on employment discrimination and Latino educational attainment in scholarly journals.
As the former Study Director for the Women of Color Policy Network at New York University, she used her statistical knowledge and techniques to design survey tools, supervise various research projects, co-author research reports, and present findings at professional meetings and conferences nationwide.
Garcia’s employment and research experience is deeply rooted in higher education. Immediately prior to joining HACR, she was a faculty member at George Mason University; she has also taught at New York University, Montclair State University, and Ohio State.
An active member of Sigma Lambda Upsilon/Señoritas Latinas Unidas Sorority, Inc., she held a seat on the national leadership team and represented the organization through service on the board of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO). Additionally, Garcia has served as a mentor for young women through the sorority’s LADYS program and participated in numerous community service projects with Alumni chapters in New Jersey and Virginia, focusing on the organization’s national initiative to promote literacy in the Latino community.
In addition to her doctoral degree, Garcia holds an M.S. in Sociology from Virginia Tech and dual undergraduate degrees from Penn State in Sociology and Labor and Industrial Relations. She is a proud recipient of the NCID Exemplary Diversity Scholar Citation for her contributions in diversity-related research, practice, and teaching.
