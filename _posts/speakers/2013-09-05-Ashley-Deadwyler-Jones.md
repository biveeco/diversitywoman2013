Ashley Deadwyler-Jones was born and raised in Wilmington, Delaware.  She graduated from The Tatnall School, and later attended Spelman College where she graduated with her Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology and Management Organization in 1998.  At both institutions, Ashley displayed a distinguished level of academic achievements as she was recognized in Who’s Who of America and remained on the honor roll throughout her high school & collegiate careers.  During her matriculation at Spelman College, Ashley was recognized as a Bonner, UNCF, Delta Sigma Theta, & Laffey Mchugh Scholar. 
 
Upon completion of Spelman, Ashley took her budding career to Wall Street where she worked as an Investment Banker with Morgan Stanley specializing in Debt Capital Markets.  Later, Ashley transitioned her career into “Big Pharma” where she worked for Merck & Co. for 7 years.  While at Merck, she held the title of Senior Specialty Representative and served as an Advisory Board member. In her role she acted as a change agent; providing progressive ideas to an international sales force, where she managed and provided product consultation to both primary care and healthcare specialists throughout the Southeastern Region.
 
Seeking additional professional development, Ashley received her Masters of Business Administration from Clark Atlanta University in 2005.  As a result of her academic success, leadership, dedication and many accomplishments, Ashley was asked to join State Farm (the nation’s leading auto and home insurance provider).  Upon joining State Farm, Ashley held the title of Southern Zone Marketing Consultant where she served as the multi-cultural marketing liaison spearheading sponsorships like The Magic City Classic, Fiesta Atlanta, For Sisters Only and Real Men Cook to name a few.  Ashley was also responsible for managing the marketing and advertising programs for over two hundred State Farm agents throughout metro Atlanta.
 
After 3 short years with State Farm, Ashley completed the State Farm agency owner process and opened the doors to the Ashley Deadwyler-Jones State Farm Agency in Silver Spring, MD.  Since the launch of her business, Ashley has been recognized in State Farm’s Mid-Atlantic Hall of Fame as having one of the most successful agency launches in history.  After 3 years in business, the agency continues to flourish as it was recently ranked 58 out of 18,000 State Farm Agents in U.S and Canada in homeowner’s insurance production.
 
Finally, and above all of Ashley’s professional and academic accomplishments, Ashley is most proud of her 12 year marriage to, Mr. Jacobi Jones, and their two darling little boys Jacobi Jones II and Joshua Jones.
