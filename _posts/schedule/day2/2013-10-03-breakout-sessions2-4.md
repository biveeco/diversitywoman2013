Nurturing and protecting oneâ€™s team is a natural instinct that contributes to highly effective, motivating and productive work groups. There comes a point, however, when these efforts can morph productive teams into dysfunctional silos and become counterproductive for the organization as a whole. According to management guru Stephen Covey, a meager 37 percent of employees have a clear understanding of what their company is trying to achieve and why, which he attributes to the silo effect. What is the key to breaking down silos and building community across business units? Simple communication strategies, when used effectively, can make the difference between an organization divided and one working together to achieve common goals. Discover the most effective ways to build and maintain unity across your organization.
