Empowering our sisters in the workplace will help us collectively break down that glass ceiling once and for all. Empowerment begins with supporting one another to build confidence and is ultimately demonstrated through ownership: ownership of ideas, of relationships, of oneâ€™s own career trajectory. Join our keynote for a thought-provoking invitation to think about empowerment through the lens of inclusivity and mutual support. Learn the most effective tools to empower yourself and your female colleagues to collectively remove gender barriers, and consider impactful ways to empower even the youngest ladies in your life. If not now, when?
