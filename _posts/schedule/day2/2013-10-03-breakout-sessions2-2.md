A corner office—symbolic of making it to the C-suite—is often a goal of rising professionals. Only a select few ever make it there; indeed, fewer than 5% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women even though, according to AOL Jobs, women now outnumber men in the U.S. workforce. Many female CEOs find that once they reach that coveted spot it can be quite lonely. Every move is scrutinized, every decision analyzed, and every statement taken as an order. Share with your peers your experiences in achieving the rank of executive and discuss how you can help pave an easier path for emerging leaders in your organization that may, one day, help grow the number of female Fortune 500 CEOs.
