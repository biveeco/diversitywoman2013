A 2011 LinkedIn study reported that while nearly 82% of U.S. women believe it is important to have a mentor, only one in five professional women have engaged in mentoring relationships. Mentors and mentoring relationships come in all shapes and sizes; indeed, many mentors are now younger than their mentees and, increasingly, mentoring relationships are thriving virtually thanks to skype and other connecting tools. What should women look for as they seek out potential sponsors and how might they reach beyond their “own universe” to intentionally broaden their perspectives? What are proven processes and tools one can use to help form and nurture a meaningful mentoring relationship? This engaging session explores these and other questions and offers tangible takeaways for attendees looking to mentor or be mentored.
