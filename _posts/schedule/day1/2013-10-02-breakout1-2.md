Today’s leaner organizations and increased pressure for solid ROI leave no room for gender differences to impede productivity, and yet gender differences still create a challenging work environment. While gender differences in work styles are well documented, it’s never been more important for male and female colleagues to get past perceived barriers and work toward enhancing collaboration and teamwork. This session will explore natural differences and propose tangible strategies to help you create a work environment that embraces these differences while creating a
stronger sense of alignment around mission, purpose and goals. Through an engaging, lively and fun discussion, attendees will consider the attitudes, beliefs and behaviors that contribute to and get in the way of progress and results.
