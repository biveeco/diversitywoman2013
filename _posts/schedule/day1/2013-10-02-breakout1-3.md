What do you really want out of your life and career? Within your role at work, how do you go about advancing your efforts when someone or something stands in your way? Being a knowledgeable and skilled professional will only get you so far. At some point, everyone needs to leverage negotiation skills to surpass barriers, whether it’s for securing the next promotion, advocating for a specific project, or making sure your child receives the education she/he deserves. Interestingly, research from Carnegie Mellon in 2011 shows that men negotiate four times more often than women. It’s time to reverse that number! Join negotiation experts to learn and practice negotiation strategies, discuss when and how to use them effectively, and discover communication techniques that will aid in achieving your goals.
