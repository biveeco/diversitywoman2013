What role do men play in helping women executives break the glass ceiling? Most of us have experienced a male mentor who coached us, opened doors for us, and broadened our perspectivesâ€¦not just because we are women, but because we are women with strong potential. How can we multiply those unique experiences so that more women benefit from men who are dedicated to helping aspiring leaders achieve their career goals? This panel discussion addresses the role of men in cultivating and nurturing female talent and uncovers specific tactics and strategies for making these special mentoring relationships work.
