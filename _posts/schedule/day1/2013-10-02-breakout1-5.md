Successful professionals have strong presence. They exhibit confidence and show ownership over their work, their career paths, their personal lives. Having a strong identity means being clear about who you are and what you stand forâ€¦and never losing sight of that guiding compass. Not surprisingly, very few working women devote specific time to developing their presence. Join this workshop to engage in exercises designed to help you reflect on your own identity and learn how that translates into your overall presence at home and at work. Consider how to leverage YOUR unique identity to achieve lasting success.
